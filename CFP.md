# Level Up with 100 Days of Code

## Title
Level Up with 100 Days of Code

## Elevator Pitch
100 Days of Code has been described as “the fastest way to form a coding habit”.  But it’s more than just a time-boxed guide to developing a habit.  Using the 100 Days of Code approach you can increase your understanding of a programming language, develop a portfolio of projects, and create opportunities to grow in your career.

In this discussion, we’ll cover the origins of the 100 Days of Code movement, tools and resources that you can use along the way, and specific goals you can use to guide your progress.  Throughout the discussion, you’ll find that the 100 Days of Code method can be used by people at all stages of their careers.  In addition, you’ll get an introduction to Blacks in Technology’s 100 Days of Code community, a welcoming group of life-long learners just like you.

Your host for this discussion is Michael Jenkins, a seasoned computer engineer and an advocate for the BIT 100 Days of Code community.

## Description
Many people in our community are working to become technologists.  They're studying computer science as bootcamp or college students; they're working in industries adjacent to technology, thinking about going full time; or they're in a role totally unrelated to technology but looking to make a change.

In each of these scenarios, people wonder, "what's it really like working as a software developer, cloud engineer, or technical project manager day to day"?

This session will feature three panelists that can answer this question from different perspectives in their careers based on years of experience:

- The "junior" level, with 0 to 3 years of experience
- The "senior" level, with 5 or more years of experience
- And the "principal" level, with many years of experience

Each panelist will share how they started in their tech-focused career and what some of the bumps and turns have been like along the way.  They'll share what their typical day is like along with some of the tools and technologies they use on a regular basis.  Additionally, they will share tips and strategies for networking, getting up to speed with technology, and staying abreast of changes in their industries and fields.

Attendees at this interactive session will have the opportunity to ask questions to get answers directly from the panelists.

Anyone considering a role that uses or creates technology will leave this session with a better idea of what it's like working in tech, either just starting out or well along the way.
You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.

## Notes
This field supports Markdown. Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...

Notes
This session is intended to be a panel discussion with Michael Jenkins as the moderator. He may also serve as a panelist if needed.  Ideally, the panel will be made up of engineers from The Walt Disney Company at varying levels of their careers.  If the panel can be made up of all TWDC engineers, the session may benefit from changing the title to "A Day in the Life of a Junior/Senior/Principal Engineer at The Walt Disney Company".

In either case (an all TWDC panel or not), Mr. Jenkins will work to secure panelists for the session in advance.  The pool of candidates will include BIT members participating in BITCON 2022.

Hey folks!  Just checking in after the first week of this 100 DoC sprint.
While there’s no right or wrong way to do it, there are plenty of ways to get going.
Here are a few!
:woman_in_lotus_position::skin-tone-5: Focus mode: Pick one language and level up each day with a small lesson.  that way at the end of the sprint you’ll be a complete pro!
:mortar_board: Polyglot style: Pick multiple languages and spend time with each one learning the differences and similarities by solving the same problems with each language.
:briefcase: Project+Portfolio:  Use the first ~33.3 days planning a project and researching the tech needed to implement it.  Use the next ~33.3 days coding up the project.  Then take the last ~33.3 days to fix bugs, wrap things up, and telling the story of how it all came together.  Pro tip: use this approach to develop presentations for conferences, blog posts, and other outlets to build your portfolio!! :think-about-it:
